# Rate Limiting in Ruby

A few bare-bones implementations of various
rate limiting techniques such as token bucket
and window counter. The algorithms mostly
come from Alex Wu's System Design Interview
book.

Ruby is an excellent choice for these kinds
of small demonstrations as they can be written
as middleware for Rack.
